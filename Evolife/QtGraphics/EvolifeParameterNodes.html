<h2>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms</h2>


<h3>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> SumBits</h3>
This example is meant as a didactic approach to genetic algorithms (and certainly not as a realistic application, as the problem is much too simple for a GA). The problem is to maximize the number of bits set to 1 in a binary vector. Starting from a random population, in which individuals have only roughly half of the bits equals to 1 in their genome, evolution through natural selection should rapidly produce 'perfect' individuals whose genome is uniformly made of 1s.

<h3>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> Labyrinth</h3>
Scenario Labyrinth:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals' DNA guides a 'robot' through a labyrinth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the hope of getting out of it

<h4>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> WernerDyer ==> Compass</h4>
Indicates whether the female part of the DNA codes for absolute directions (East, North, West, South) (Compass==1)<br>or codes for direction change (straight on, left, right, u-turn) (Compass==0).<br>

<h4>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> WernerDyer ==> WDGridSize</h4>


<h5>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> WernerDyer ==> WDGridSize ==> 100</h5>


<h3>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> Zip</h3>
This scenario uses a genetic algorithm to simplify a string, or conversely make it more complex. <br>Here, complexity is assessed by the size of its compressed length (using compressor gzip or bzip2). <br>The point is to show that simplification produces quasi-periodic strings and that it is difficult <br>for standard genetic algorithms to escape from local optima.<br><br>When the 'Simplify' parameter is set to 0, the programme ideally attempts to <br>generate a random (i.e. incompressible) sequence.<br><br>In the not-BitString mode, the evolution gets more obviously trapped in many local optima.<br>

<h4>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> Zip ==> BitString</h4>
If BitString is set to 0, the DNA is translated into a string of charaters '0' and '1'<br>Otherwise it is translated into a binary string

<h5>Scenarios ==> Genetic Algorithms ==> Zip ==> BitString ==> 0</h5>

<h2>Scenarios ==> Behavioural Ecology</h2>


<h3>Scenarios ==> Behavioural Ecology ==> Favourable</h3>
Simple Darwinian scenario: carriers of gene named 'Favourable' get life points.<br>The gene is expected to invade the population.<br>Alternatively, individuals get some collective benefit from the fact that<br>there are carriers of the 'Favourable' gene in the group. In that case,<br>the fate of the gene is no longer obvious, even if the collective benefit is high!

<h3>Scenarios ==> Behavioural Ecology ==> GreenBeard</h3>
This small experiment was proposed in Richard Dawkins's book The selfish gene. It shows how some interesting coupling between genes may emerge in a population.<br><br>Suppose a given gene has two effects on its carriers: (1) they get a conspicuous characteristic, like a green beard; (2) they tend to behave altruistically toward green-bearded individuals. Such a gene is expected to invade the population, whereas its allele (no green beard + no altruism) tends to disappear. <br>

<h5>Scenarios ==> Behavioural Ecology ==> GreenBeard ==> GB_Cost ==> 10</h5>


<h3>Scenarios ==> Behavioural Ecology ==> SexRatio</h3>
If the sex ratio in the progeny is genetically controlled, a 50-50 ratio <br>emerges, despite the fact that males consume resources without investing<br>in offspring. <br>However, in hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants), in which males are haploid <br>(one exemplar for each chomosome) whereas females are diploid (two exemplars<br>of each chromosome), sex ratio is expected to converge toward 25-75 whenever <br>it is controlled by genes expressed in sisters (workers).<br>

<h3>Scenarios ==> Dyadic games ==> CostlySignal</h3>
EVOLIFE: Costly Signal Scenario:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals may emit a signal in relation with their quality.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emitting this signal involves a cost.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receivers read the signal and decide to associate or not with the emitter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association provides benefit to emitters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association provides benefit to receivers only if emitter is of high quality.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution leads to a situation in which communication is honest,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. individuals signal their true quality.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the fact that liars (l-q signalling individuals) cannot<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afford the cost of high signals.<br>

<h5>Scenarios ==> Dyadic games ==> Signalling ==> RankEffect ==> 80</h5>


<h4>Scenarios ==> Dyadic games ==> Signalling ==> SignallingCost</h4>
Cost of producing signals.<br>Signals may indirectly reveal the signaller's competence.<br>This is only true if individuals invest in signalling.<br>Signalling investments are genetically controlled.<br><br>Typical value: 20

<h3>Scenarios ==> Dyadic games ==> StagHunt</h3>
Stag Hunt Scenario (after Brian Skyrms, "The stag hunt",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 67-70)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stag hunt scenario, two players have the choice:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- either to cooperate to hunt a stag (S)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- or to defect and hunt a hare (H) for themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payoff matrix is as follows:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opponent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; H<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;player&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; 7<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a particular case of stag hunt in which it is better to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunt hare against a stag hunter rather than against a hare hunter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such game is also called "assurance game".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of any signalling, there are two equilibria:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone hunts stag or everyone hunts hare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If individuals are given the possibility of sending a binary signal before<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acting, then the new situation creates one equilibrium in which<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half of the population sends signal 0 and hunts stag with those having sent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 and hunts hare otherwise, and conversely for the other half.
