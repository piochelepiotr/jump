Emergence of segregationism
===========================

Though individual agents show only slight preference for being surrounded by similar agent,
homogeneous patches emerge.
Thomas Schelling (1971) studied the dynamics of residential segregation
to elucidate the conditions under which individual decisions about where to live
will interact to produce neighbourhoods that are segregated by race.
His model shows that this can occur even though individuals do not act
in a coordinated fashion to bring about these segregated outcomes.
Schelling proposed a prototype model in which individual agents are of two types,
say red and blue, and are placed randomly on the squares of a checkerboard.
The neighbourhood of an agent is defined to be the eight squares adjoining his location.
Each agent has preferences over the composition of his neighbourhood,
defined as the proportion of reds and blues. In each period, the most dissatisfied
agent moves to an empty square provided a square is available that he prefers
to his current location. The process continues until no one wants to move.

The typical outcome is a highly segregated state, although nobody actually
prefers segregation to integration.
