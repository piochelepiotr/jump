 Example to show how to use Evolife's graphic system 
 ===================================================

 This example shows how to use Evolife's graphic system (based on PyQT)
	to run simulations that display images,dots and lines, and curves.

	
Buttons
======

[Genome]:	Displays the genomes of the population
	- Each horizontal line represents the genome of one individual
	- Vertical patterns result from correlations between individuals
[Photo]:	Enters Photo Mode: 
	- Prints a few data on the console
	- Saves a screenshot for each opened window. Caveat: these are screenshot: 
	  Screenshots are saved automatically depending on Display Period, in .png files.
	  These files can be assembled into animated gifs e.g. using ImageMagick.
	  If you enter Film mode (by pressing key 'v'), photos are taken automatically 
	  at each display period.
	- Saves the current plots in 'Evolife.csv' (which may be opened with Excel). 
	  This file is also created when exiting Evolife.
[Run]:	Runs the simulation in continuous mode
[Step]:	Runs the simulation stepwise
[T]:	Displays trajectories (when applicable)
[A]:	Displays alliances (social links between individuals, sorted by competence) (when applicable)
[F]:	Displays agents' positions on a 2-D field
[L]:	Log messages (not implemented)
[Help]:	Displays this help file




Shortcuts:
======

<Esc>:	quits the active window (and the application if main window is active) (like 'q')
<F1>:	displays this help file
a:	displays alliances (social links between individuals, sorted by competence) (when applicable)
c:	runs the simulation in continuous mode (like 'r')
f:	displays a 2-D field on which agents may be located
g:	displays genomes 
h:	displays this help file
l:	displays log messages (not implemented)
m:	alternatively brings main window or satellite windows to foreground
q:	quits the active window (and the application if main window is active) (like <Esc>)
r:	runs the simulation in continuous mode (like 'c')
s:	runs the simulation one step forward (like <space>)
t:	displays trajectories (when applicable)
v:	enters film mode. One picture per opened window is recorded
z:	shrinks satellite windows (field, genomes, alliances, labyrinth...) (dezoom)
-:	shrinks satellite windows (field, genomes, alliances, labyrinth...) (dezoom)
+:	expands satellite windows (field, genomes, alliances, labyrinth...) (zoom)

(shortcuts also work from satellite windows)
