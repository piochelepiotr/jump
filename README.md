## Presentation

This project is an implemeation of a neural network, that learns with a genetic algorithm.
The neural network and the genetic algorithm are both coded from scratch, without using an external library, so this project was more about understanding how a genetic algorithm works.

The goal is to make a monster move on a map with a neural network, we learns what are the good moves.

At the end, it works, but for this problem, a neural net isn't effective. The problem is too simple so all the program does is to learn by heart the moves he has to do depending on the environment.

## Library

As it was a school project, we had to make our project reusable buy the teacher for future improvments ,so we had to use Evolife.
It makes the code more complex to understand.
